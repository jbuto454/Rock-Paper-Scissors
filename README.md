# Javascript_Rock_Paper_Scissors

Completed as part of the "Odin Project" web development course. To run the program, use the game() function you will see a dialog box that asks you to enter in one of the following: Rock, Paper, or Scissors. Once you have entered in your choice, the computer will also make a selection and the console will tell you whether you or the computer won the round. The function executes 5 times, for 5 rounds of rock paper scissors. Will be adding a UI soon.
